  <article id="https://www.notion.so/e384ea46149a4bb8827507839485d279" class="PageRoot"><div id="https://www.notion.so/d2e50fb60c784e3c9754c550354c0b60" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">My first job was as a &quot;data scientist,&quot; but it was more like a software engineer. After working in a company for two years, I realized that I was gradually losing my passion for the job. The main reason was that I realized my passion was no longer aligned with the current job content. During those two years, I had the opportunity to delve into algorithms, learn about new technologies, and understand the software engineering process. I enjoyed tackling challenging problems and optimizing system performance. However, after working on several projects, I noticed that my expertise was not expanding as much as I had hoped. This was because during project development, I would often choose a safe approach based on known knowledge or skills, considering multiple factors. As a result, most of my time was spent on software engineering tasks such as optimizing system performance, code maintenance, and application deployment. When solving software engineering challenges became a routine and industrialized task, my interest faded away. Even though I worked long hours and felt exhausted, I always felt that something was missing, that a part of my energy was not being unleashed.</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/8f250f49ba0f408487a6a702eecfbf3e" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">I realized that I am someone who thrives on new environments and challenges. I am not afraid to try new things and make mistakes. I enjoy solving engineering problems, but I don&#x27;t want to be just a code-producing machine, replicating things that has already been done by others. I have recognized that the untapped energy during work comes from creativity.I am driven by a desire to explore and create, which is evident in my practical experiences. I have developed applications that combine embedded systems and gesture recognition to control LED lights as well as explored sensor and gateway data transmission protocols due to my interest in the Internet of Things. What I want to express is that when one possesses creativity, their potential and energy are immense. However, once a challenge becomes familiar and no longer new, my enthusiasm quickly diminishes. It&#x27;s like when learning to swim, sometimes you accidentally swallow pool water because you haven&#x27;t mastered the breathing technique. At that time, there is no fear because subconsciously you understand that making mistakes is inevitable in the beginning, so you don&#x27;t retreat just because you swallowed some pool water. However, once you become familiar with swimming and know the correct techniques, you may lose interest because your subconscious restricts you to using only the standard movements. But it doesn&#x27;t mean you give up swimming; you still continue swimming and try new swimming styles, just without the initial excitement. What I want to express is that once something has a fixed framework or process, it means that it is no longer a challenge, and thus the meaning of the challenge is lost.</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/3348716e92f942a887332375ca6dd077" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">I have a passion for problem-solving in engineering. During my university years, I had the opportunity to develop a frontend application for motion action counting using a human skeleton estimation model. In my previous job, I actively contributed to the development of an intelligent surveillance system based on object detection algorithms, as well as a project focused on product defect detection using anomaly detection and image recognition techniques. Furthermore, I played a key role in a project analyzing worker actions, where I successfully implemented an unsupervised action segmentation algorithm tailored to the project&#x27;s requirements after studying relevant algorithm papers. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also sparked my interest in reading research papers. Through delving into these papers, I gained a deeper understanding of the authors&#x27; thought processes and admired their writing skills. I used to hold a somewhat elitist view of research papers, assuming they were solely the domain of erudite scholars. However, my perspective changed as I realized that research papers serve as a mediums for scholars to share knowledge, ideas, and thoughts. This newfound appreciation has fueled my desire to continue reading and, ultimately, contribute my own ideas and knowledge in the future. I have realized that it is time for me to further enhance myself. Instead of changing jobs, I prefer to continue learning new knowledge to enrich my arsenal, so that I can fully unleash my creativity and imagination to embrace new challenges. I believe that writing code and writing papers are mediums for expressing creativity, providing opportunities for me to unleash my full potential.</span></span></p></div><div id="https://www.notion.so/15dda117c0264469a79d27c9b86404c3" class="ColorfulBlock ColorfulBlock--ColorDefault Text"><p class="Text__Content"><span class="SemanticStringArray"></span></p></div></article>
